# Pneumonia Classification in X-Rays using cNN.
## Description:

The goal for this project was to build from scratch a cNN in order to classify lumb X-Rays to detect Pneumonia while learning architectures in neural networks and how do they work. The dataset is available in this [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images?resource=download-directory).

Why not using pre-existing architectures? I wanted to get an intuition of how some changes affect the performance and/or final result, in a possitive or negative way. I ran it in my laptop so the code is not so heavy.
Some of the challenges faced was precisely OOM errors, and a strategie to address this int he future could be working with batches.

*Hablar de las estrategias usadas como la calidad de las imagenes, data augmentation y la interpretacion de resultados. Tambien de la arquitectura usada y las cosas atipicas*

This code was for a class assignment for a Diploma Degree I was taking and was part of the learning process.
